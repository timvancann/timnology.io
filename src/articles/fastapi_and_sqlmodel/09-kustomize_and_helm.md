title: Kustomize and Helm
order: 9
---

If you're running locally without PostgreSQL, you'll need to deploy it. (If you already have a database, feel free to skip ahead â€“ timestamps are in the description.)

Kustomize allows us to reference Helm charts, so instead of building our own PostgreSQL setup, we can use the well-maintained Bitnami chart. We'll only customize the PostgreSQL credentials through our values file.
